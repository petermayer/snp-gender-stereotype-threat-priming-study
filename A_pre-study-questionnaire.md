# Pre-Study Questionnaire

We will show you several videos below during the study. Please make sure that you can also hear the sound of the video. It is very important for our study that the video plays correctly.
Please watch each video until the end. If you like, you can rewind the video or watch it multiple times. After that, please click "next". On the next page we will ask you to answer some questions about the video you just watched. After that, you will be shown another video on the next page.
Once you are ready, please click "next" to start the study.

[FOR EACH VIDEO] We will now ask you to answer some questions regarding the video you just saw. _[fixed order, 7-point Likert-like scale, 1=not at all, 7=very much]_
