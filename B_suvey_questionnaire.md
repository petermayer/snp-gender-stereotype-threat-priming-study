_Debriefing_
Thank you for participating in our study!
As you may have noticed, we are not only interested in your perception of different commercials, but also in your IT security and privacy attitudes and behavior. With this study, we aim to investigate how the stereotypic portrayal of women and men in commercials affects their interest in IT security and privacy topics.
For this purpose, we asked you to watch two commercials that, depending on your experimental group, either a) portrayed women in a stereotypic mother/spouse role, b) portrayed men in a stereotypic role as scientist/engineer, c) did not contain any stereotypic portrayal of women or men.
Please note that these are stereotypes and not inherent traits - women can be scientists or engineers just as men can be stay-at-home fathers and spouses!
You are now finished with the study and will be redirected on the next page.
